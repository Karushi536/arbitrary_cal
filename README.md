# Arbitrary Precision Integer Calculator

# üöÄ Introduction
Welcome to the Arbitrary Precision Integer Calculator!
This project solves a classic programming challenge: performing arithmetic on integers of arbitrary size in a language that doesn't have native support for large numbers.

Why does this matter? Traditional programming languages often impose size limitations on numbers or rely on floating-point arithmetic, which can lead to inaccuracies for extremely large values. This calculator breaks those barriers by manually implementing arithmetic from the ground up!

# ‚ú® Key Features
Infinite Precision: Handles arbitrarily large integers without size restrictions.
Rich Arithmetic Support:
Addition (+)
Subtraction (-)
Multiplication (*)
Division (/)
Modulo (%)
Exponentiation (^)
Factorials (fact)
Interactive REPL: Includes a user-friendly Read-Eval-Print Loop (REPL) for live computations.
Robust Edge-Handling: Built to gracefully manage cases like division by zero, large factorials, and negative results.

# üß† How It Works
This calculator simulates basic arithmetic operations by treating numbers as strings and performing digit-by-digit calculations. Here's the thought process behind the solution:

String Representation: Instead of using native number types, numbers are stored as strings, allowing them to scale infinitely.
Digit-by-Digit Computation: Arithmetic operations are manually implemented, mimicking how you would calculate by hand.
Custom Logic for Edge Cases: Safeguards like handling division by zero and zero factorial ensure accuracy and reliability.

# üíª Usage
1. Run the REPL
To start the calculator, simply run the Python script:

bash
Copy code
python <script_name>.py

2. Interact with the REPL
Use standard mathematical notation to perform operations:

Examples:
text
Copy code
>> 123456789123456789 + 987654321987654321
1111111111111111110

>> 2 ^ 100
1267650600228229401496703205376

>> fact 20
2432902008176640000
Type exit or quit to close the REPL.

# üõ†Ô∏è Built From Scratch
Here‚Äôs what makes this project interesting:

Addition & Subtraction: Carry and borrow logic implemented manually.
Multiplication: Uses a nested loop to simulate digit-by-digit multiplication.
Division: Simulates long division for large numbers.
Exponentiation: Repeated multiplication for power operations.
Factorial: Efficient iterative computation for massive factorials.
No external libraries or built-in arbitrary-precision types were used for the core logic‚Äîjust pure Python and problem-solving ingenuity!

# üåü Why It's Awesome
This project showcases:

Algorithmic Creativity: Tackling arithmetic operations manually is a great exercise in understanding computational logic.
Scalability: Designed to handle numbers far beyond the limits of conventional data types.
Practical Application: Whether you're exploring number theory or learning the internals of computation, this tool has you covered.

# ü§î Potential Extensions
Looking to enhance the calculator? Here are some ideas:

Support for non-decimal bases (e.g., binary, hexadecimal).
Fraction handling for precise division results.
Additional mathematical operations (e.g., square root, logarithms).
Performance optimization for even larger inputs.
